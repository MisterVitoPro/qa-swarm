  Implement fixes from a QA swarm analysis: write TDD tests, fix code by priority, loop
  until tests pass. Takes the 3 output file paths from a /qa-swarm:attack run.
argument-hint: "<report.md> <spec.md> <tests.md>"
---

You are orchestrating QA Swarm implementation. You will write tests, fix code, and loop until green.

## Progress Tracking

Use Claude Tasks (TaskCreate, TaskUpdate) throughout this pipeline to track progress. The user should always be able to see what has been done, what is in progress, and what remains.

**Reference the implementation plan:** The spec and report files contain the prioritized findings and fix details. All tasks you create should reference the relevant finding IDs and spec sections so that agents and the user can trace each task back to the plan.

### Task Creation Strategy

After ingesting the report and the user selecting phases, create tasks structured as follows:

1. **One top-level task per selected phase** (e.g., "Phase 1: P0 Critical (3 issues)")
2. **One sub-task per individual finding within that phase** (e.g., "Fix P0-001: SQL injection in get_user_by_id")
3. **Pipeline tasks** for cross-cutting steps (e.g., "TDD Setup", "Final Test Run", "Write Results Report")

### Task Status Updates

Mark tasks `in_progress` when starting work on them. Mark `completed` immediately when done -- do not batch completions. If a task fails or is skipped, update it with the reason.

Use these conventions in task descriptions:
- Include the finding ID (e.g., P0-001) and title
- Reference the spec file and section for fix details (e.g., "See {spec_path} > P0 Fixes > Fix P0-001")
- Include the relevant test file path once TDD setup is complete
- For retry tasks, include the attempt number and prior error

**IMPORTANT:** Before modifying any code, verify that the current working tree is clean or committed. If there are uncommitted changes, warn the user:
```
Warning: You have uncommitted changes. If fixes go wrong, you may lose work.
Recommendation: Commit or stash your changes before proceeding.
Continue anyway? (Y/n)
```
Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

## Arguments

Parse the three file paths from the arguments: `{$ARGUMENTS}`

Expected: `<report_path> <spec_path> <test_plan_path>`

## Step 1: VALIDATE AND INGEST

1. Parse the three file paths from the arguments. If fewer than three paths are provided, print:
   ```
   Error: Expected 3 file paths, got {N}.

   Usage: /qa-swarm:implement <report.md> <spec.md> <test_plan.md>
   Example: /qa-swarm:implement docs/qa-swarm/2026-04-02-report.md docs/qa-swarm/2026-04-02-spec.md docs/qa-swarm/2026-04-02-tests.md

   Run /qa-swarm:attack first to generate these files.
   ```
   Then STOP.

2. Check that all three files exist. For EACH missing file, collect the error. If any are missing, print:
   ```
   Cannot start implementation -- missing files:
     {path_1}  <-- not found
     {path_2}  <-- not found

   Expected files in docs/qa-swarm/:
     {date}-report.md   (ranked findings)
     {date}-spec.md     (implementation spec)
     {date}-tests.md    (TDD test plan)

   Run /qa-swarm:attack first to generate these files.
   ```
   Then STOP.

3. Read all three files.
4. Parse the report to extract findings grouped by priority (P0, P1, P2, P3).
5. Count total findings per priority level. If total findings is 0, print:
   ```
   No findings to implement -- the report contains 0 actionable findings.
   ```
   Then STOP.
6. Check for an existing results file at `docs/qa-swarm/{DATE}-results.md`.
   - If found, read it and mark already-fixed issues as complete.
   - This enables incremental runs across sessions.

## Step 2: PHASE SELECTION

Present the user with a summary table and let them choose what to tackle:

```
QA Swarm Implementation
========================
Report:    {report_path}
Spec:      {spec_path}
Test Plan: {test_plan_path}

 Phase | Priority    | Issues | Status
-------|-------------|--------|------------
   1   | P0 Critical |   {N}  | {status}
   2   | P1 High     |   {N}  | {status}
   3   | P2 Medium   |   {N}  | {status}
   4   | P3 Low      |   {N}  | {status}

Status key: Not started | Partial (N/M) | Done (N/N)

Options:
  [A]   All phases (P0 -> P1 -> P2 -> P3)
  [1]   Phase 1 only
  [2]   Phase 2 only
  [3]   Phase 3 only
  [4]   Phase 4 only
  [1-2] Phases 1 through 2
  [1,3] Phases 1 and 3

Select phases:
```

Wait for user selection before proceeding. Parse their input to determine which phases to run.

### Create Tasks After Phase Selection

Once the user selects phases, create the full task tree using TaskCreate:

1. Create a pipeline task: `"TDD Setup: Write test files for selected phases"`
2. For each selected phase, create a phase task:
   - `"Phase 1: P0 Critical ({N} issues)"` with description referencing the spec:
     `"Fix {N} P0 findings. See {spec_path} > P0 Fixes for implementation-ready details. Strict ordering: one at a time, 4 retry max, halt on failure."`
3. For each finding within each selected phase, create a sub-task:
   - `"Fix {finding_id}: {title}"` with description:
     `"Location: {file}:{line}. Fix details: {spec_path} > P0 Fixes > Fix {finding_id}. Test: {test_file_path (once known)}. Confidence: {confidence}. Corroborated by: {N} agents."`
4. Create pipeline tasks for wrap-up:
   - `"Final test suite verification"`
   - `"Write results report to docs/qa-swarm/{DATE}-results.md"`

## Step 3: TDD SETUP (3 parallel test-writer agents)

Mark the TDD Setup task as `in_progress`.

### 3a. Detect Context7 MCP availability

Check whether the Context7 MCP server is available in this session by looking for the tools `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` and `mcp__context7__query-docs`. Record the result as `context7_available: true | false`. You will pass this flag to each test-writer agent.

If available, print: `Context7 MCP detected -- test-writer agents will use it for current framework docs.`
If not available, print: `Context7 MCP not detected -- test-writer agents will rely on existing test conventions only.`

### 3b. Partition the test plan across 3 agents

1. Read the test plan file and filter to findings in the SELECTED PHASES ONLY. Skip any finding already marked `ALREADY COVERED` in the plan.
2. Group the remaining findings by their `test_file_path`. Each group represents one test file's worth of work.
3. Distribute the groups across up to 3 buckets, balanced by the total number of test cases per bucket. Rule: **each test file is assigned to exactly one bucket** -- no two agents ever write the same file (prevents write conflicts).
4. If there are fewer than 3 distinct test files, use fewer agents (1 agent per file). Do not spawn empty agents.
5. Name the buckets `slice-A`, `slice-B`, `slice-C`.

Print a partition summary:
```
TDD partitioning:
  slice-A: {N} findings across {M} test files
  slice-B: {N} findings across {M} test files
  slice-C: {N} findings across {M} test files
```

### 3c. Launch 3 qa-tdd agents in parallel

Launch the test-writer agents **in a single message with multiple Agent tool calls** so they run concurrently. Each agent (model: sonnet, Mode 2) receives:

- Its assigned slice of the test plan (only its bucket's findings + test code blocks, inlined into the prompt)
- The list of test file paths it owns -- with an explicit instruction that it MUST NOT write to any file outside this list
- The `context7_available` boolean
- Conventions guidance: read 2-3 existing test files in the project to detect framework, naming, and file layout before writing
- Instruction: DO NOT run the test suite. The orchestrator runs the suite once after all 3 agents finish.

Each agent returns a structured JSON summary:
```json
{
  "slice": "slice-A",
  "files_written": ["tests/unit/test_auth.py", ...],
  "tests_written": [{"finding_id": "P0-001", "test_name": "test_sql_injection_login", "file": "..."}],
  "context7_queries": [{"library": "pytest", "purpose": "confirm fixture API"}],
  "skipped": [{"finding_id": "...", "reason": "..."}]
}
```

### 3d. Run the full test suite once

After all 3 agents return, run the FULL test suite (detected test command for the project).

Classify each new test:
- **FAIL (expected)**: finding stays in the implementation queue -- red phase verified.
- **PASS (unexpected)**: finding is likely already fixed or false positive. Remove from queue, print:
  ```
  Tests already passing (removed from queue):
    - {finding_id}: {title} -- likely already fixed or false positive
  ```
  Mark that finding's sub-task `completed` with the "already passing" note.
- **ERRORED (did not run)**: treat as a TDD setup bug. Print the error, mark the sub-task `in_progress` with a note, and continue -- the fix agent in Step 4 may correct it.

Update each remaining finding sub-task description to include its test file path.

Mark the TDD Setup task as `completed`.

## Step 4: PHASE EXECUTION

Execute selected phases in priority order (P0 always runs first even if user selected [2,1]).

### P0 Phase (Strict Ordering)

Mark the Phase 1 task as `in_progress`.

For EACH P0 finding, one at a time:

1. Mark the finding sub-task as `in_progress`.
2. Print: `Fixing P0: [{finding_id}] {title} (attempt 1/{max_retries})`

3. Launch an implementation agent (model: opus) with:
   - The specific P0 finding from the report
   - The implementation-ready fix steps from the spec (tell the agent: "Read {spec_path} > P0 Fixes > Fix {finding_id} for the exact steps.")
   - The relevant test file(s) for this finding
   - Instruction: "Read the spec's fix steps for this finding. Implement the fix exactly. Do not modify test files."

4. After the agent completes, run the FULL test suite (not just the new tests).

5. Check results:
   - **All tests pass**: Print `P0 [{finding_id}] FIXED`. Mark the sub-task as `completed`. Move to next P0.
   - **New test failures appeared**: The fix broke something.
     - Launch the implementation agent again with the error output.
     - Instruct: "Your fix for {finding_id} caused these test failures: {failures}. Fix the regression without reverting the original fix."
     - Retry up to 4 total attempts. Update the sub-task description with each attempt's outcome.
   - **After 4 failed attempts**: HALT.
     Update the sub-task with: "HALTED after 4 attempts. Last error: {error}. Awaiting user guidance."
     ```
     HALTED: P0 [{finding_id}] could not be fixed after 4 attempts.

     What was tried:
     {summary of each attempt}

     Last error:
     {test output}

     Options:
       1. Type your fix guidance and I will retry
       2. Type "skip" to move on
       3. Type "abort" to stop implementation entirely
     ```
     Wait for user input. If they provide guidance, retry with their instructions. If "skip", mark sub-task as `completed` with note "Skipped by user". If "abort", jump to Step 5.

Mark the Phase 1 task as `completed` when all P0 findings are processed.

### P1-P3 Phases (Batched by Priority)

For each selected priority level (P1, then P2, then P3):

1. Mark the phase task as `in_progress`. Mark all finding sub-tasks in this phase as `in_progress`.
2. Print:
   ```
   Implementing {N} P{level} fixes...
   ```

3. Launch an implementation agent (model: sonnet) with:
   - All findings for this priority level from the report
   - The corresponding fix details from the spec (tell the agent: "Read {spec_path} > P{level} Fixes for approach details.")
   - The relevant test files
   - Instruction: "Implement all these fixes. Read the spec for approach details. Do not modify test files."

4. After the agent completes, run the FULL test suite.

5. Check results:
   - **All tests pass**: Print `P{level} fixes complete: {N}/{N} fixed`. Mark all sub-tasks and the phase task as `completed`.
   - **Some tests fail**: Identify which findings' tests are still failing.
     - Launch the implementation agent again with the failures.
     - Retry up to 2 total attempts.
   - **After 2 failed attempts**: Skip the failing fixes.
     Mark passing sub-tasks as `completed`. Mark failing sub-tasks as `completed` with note: "Unresolved after 2 attempts: {error_summary}".
     ```
     Skipped {N} P{level} fixes (unresolved after 2 attempts):
       - [{finding_id}] {title}: {error_summary}
     ```
     Mark the phase task as `completed`. Continue to next priority level.

## Step 5: PHASE COMPLETE + CONTINUE PROMPT

After all selected phases finish:

1. Mark the "Final test suite verification" task as `in_progress`.
2. Run the full test suite for verification.
3. Mark it as `completed`.
4. Mark the "Write results report" task as `in_progress`.
5. Update the results file incrementally at `docs/qa-swarm/{DATE}-results.md`.
6. Mark it as `completed`.
7. Print phase summary:
   ```
   Phase(s) complete.
   Fixed:      {N}/{N} issues
   Unresolved: {N} issues
   Halted:     {N} (required intervention)
   Tests:      {N} passing, {N} failing
   ```

8. If unselected phases remain, present the continue prompt:
   ```
   Remaining phases:

    Phase | Priority    | Issues | Status
   -------|-------------|--------|------------
      3   | P2 Medium   |   {N}  | Not started
      4   | P3 Low      |   {N}  | Not started

   Continue? [3/4/3-4/A/done]
   ```

9. If user selects more phases:
   - Create new phase tasks and finding sub-tasks for the newly selected phases (same structure as Step 2).
   - Create new pipeline tasks for the next round's TDD setup, final test run, and results update.
   - Loop back to Step 3 (TDD Setup for new phases).
10. If user selects "done" or no phases remain, proceed to Step 6.
